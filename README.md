ðŸ©º Interactive Health Risk Predictor

An interactive web application built with Streamlit that predicts the risk of diabetes based on key health indicators. The model is powered by a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, with preprocessing steps like imputation and scaling handled via a pipeline.

ðŸš€ Features

User-friendly interface to input health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age.

Real-time risk prediction using a trained machine learning model.

Interactive visualizations for better understanding of health data.

Portable and lightweight â€” runs directly in the browser with Streamlit.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack

Python 3

Streamlit â€“ web app framework

Scikit-learn â€“ model training & pipeline

Pandas, NumPy â€“ data manipulation

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€“ visualizations
